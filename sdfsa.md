Here is a detailed tutorial on how to design a circuit using a Raspberry Pi Hat with an SA818 module to transceive AllstarLink amateur radio communications on VHF/UHF.

Materials:

-   Raspberry Pi (any version)
-   SA818 module
-   2x female to female jumper wires
-   SMA antenna connector
-   Dupont pins and housings
-   PCB board
-   Soldering iron and solder
-   Multimeter

Step 1: Connecting the SA818 module to the Raspberry Pi The first step is to connect the SA818 module to the Raspberry Pi. To do this, you will need to use two female to female jumper wires. These wires will allow you to connect the SA818 module to the GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins of the Raspberry Pi.

1.  Take the SA818 module and locate the TXD and RXD pins. These pins will be used to send and receive data between the Raspberry Pi and the SA818 module.
2.  Connect the TXD pin of the SA818 module to pin 8 (GPIO 14) of the Raspberry Pi using one of the female to female jumper wires. Pin 8 is the eighth pin from the top left of the GPIO header. Make sure the wire is firmly attached to both the SA818 module and the Raspberry Pi.
3.  Connect the RXD pin of the SA818 module to pin 10 (GPIO 15) of the Raspberry Pi using the other female to female jumper wire. Pin 10 is the tenth pin from the top left of the GPIO header. Again, make sure the wire is firmly attached to both the SA818 module and the Raspberry Pi.
4.  Finally, connect the ground pin of the SA818 module to a ground pin on the Raspberry Pi using a third female to female jumper wire. A ground pin is any of the pins labeled "GND" on the GPIO header.

Step 2: Attaching the SMA antenna connector Next, you will need to attach the SMA antenna connector to the SA818 module. The SMA connector is a type of coaxial connector that will allow you to attach an antenna to the SA818 module.

1.  Locate the SMA connector on the SA818 module. It should be labeled "ANT".
2.  Insert the SMA connector into the hole labeled "ANT" on the SA818 module. Make sure it is inserted securely and that the pins are properly aligned.
3.  Solder the SMA connector to the SA818 module using a soldering iron and solder. Make sure that the solder forms a strong and secure connection between the SMA connector and the SA818 module.

Step 3: Soldering the Dupont pins to the PCB board

1.  Place the PCB board on a flat and stable surface.
2.  Refer to the SA818 module datasheet to identify the pins that need to be connected to the Raspberry Pi. The pins you need to solder are:
    -   Pin 1 (VCC): Connects to a 3.3V or 5V power supply
    -   Pin 2 (TXD): Connects to GPIO 14 (Pin 8) on the Raspberry Pi
    -   Pin 6 (GND): Connects to a ground pin on the Raspberry Pi
    -   Pin 9 (RXD): Connects to GPIO 15 (Pin 10) on the Raspberry Pi
    -   Pin 14 (CTCSS): Optional, can be left unconnected
    -   Pin 20 (PTT): Connects to a GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi to enable/disable transmission
    -   Pin 25 (MIC): Connects to an electret microphone to capture audio
    -   Pin 30 (SPK): Connects to a speaker or amplifier to output audio
3.  Solder Dupont pins onto the PCB board in the locations identified in step 2. Make sure the pins are securely attached and there are no loose connections.

Step 4: Connecting the SA818 module to the PCB board

1.  Insert the Dupont pins on the PCB board into the corresponding housings on the SA818 module. Make sure that the pins are properly aligned and that they fit snugly into the housings.
2.  Once the pins are inserted into the housings, secure them by pressing down on the top of the housing until it clicks into place. Repeat this process for each of the Dupont pins and housings to ensure that the SA818 module is securely connected to the PCB board.

Step 5: Configuring ASL and the SA818 module

Now that the circuit is connected and working properly, you need to configure AllStarLink (ASL) and the SA818 module to ensure proper operation.

1.  Log in to your Raspberry Pi and navigate to the ASL configuration files directory by typing the following command:

`cd /etc/asterisk` 

2.  Create a new configuration file for the SA818 module by typing the following command:

`sudo nano sa818.conf` 

3.  In the new configuration file, add the following lines:

```
[general]
port = /dev/serial0
baudrate = 9600
duplex = 1
rxboost = 1
rxctcss = 0
txctcss = 100.0
frequency = 144.3900 ; Change this to your desired frequency
```

Note: The values for the port, baudrate, rxctcss, and txctcss fields may need to be adjusted depending on your specific configuration. Refer to the SA818 module datasheet for more information on these settings.

4.  Save the file and exit nano by pressing "Ctrl + X", then "Y", and finally "Enter".
    
5.  Now navigate to the ASL configuration file by typing the following command:

`sudo nano rpt.conf` 

6.  In the configuration file, add a new node by adding the following lines:

```
[1999]
rxchannel = Radio/usb
duplex=1
erxgain=-3
etxgain=3
; controlstates=controlstates
scheduler=schedule1999
morse=morse1999
macro=macro1999
functions=functions1999
phone_functions=phone_functions1999
link_functions=link_functions1999
```

Note: The values for the node number, rxchannel, erxgain, and etxgain fields may need to be adjusted depending on your specific configuration.

7.  Save the file and exit nano by pressing "Ctrl + X", then "Y", and finally "Enter".
    
8.  Restart the Asterisk service by typing the following command:

`sudo service asterisk restart` 

9.  Test your SA818 module by connecting to another AllStarLink node or repeater. Make sure that the audio quality is clear and that the transmission and reception is reliable.

That's it! With these steps, you should now have successfully configured ASL and the SA818 module.
