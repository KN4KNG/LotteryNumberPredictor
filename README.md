# Lottery Predictor

This project is a machine learning model designed to predict the most likely set of lottery numbers for the next drawing based on previous winning numbers.

## Getting Started

To use this model, you will need to have Python installed on your computer, as well as the following libraries:

-   pandas
-   scikit-learn

To install the libraries, run the following command:

Copy code

`pip install pandas scikit-learn` 

## Usage

1.  Download the previous winning lottery numbers from your state's lottery website and save them in an Excel file.
2.  Run the `Predictor.py` file, which will train a Random Forest Regression model on the previous winning numbers and generate a set of predicted numbers.
3.  The program will output the most likely set of numbers for the next drawing.
